# 🧠 Building an LLM from Scratch – A Storytelling Journey

This repository is a **Jupyter Notebook series** that walks you through the journey of building a **Large Language Model (LLM)** from scratch. But instead of diving straight into heavy math and jargon, it tells the story in a **simple, human way**—like watching a child grow up, learn language, and eventually specialize in different roles.

### 📖 What you’ll find here:

* A storytelling explanation of **what ChatGPT really is** (not magic, but logic).
* Step-by-step coding of an LLM, starting from **day zero (baby stage)** to a **fine-tuned assistant (adult stage)**.
* Clear breakdown into **three stages**:

  1. **Learning Basics (Pretraining)** – The “baby” learns alphabets and simple patterns.
  2. **Foundation Model** – The “child” grows, reads widely, and gains general knowledge.
  3. **Fine-Tuning** – The “adult” specializes: teacher, assistant, classifier, etc.

### 🎯 Goal

By following this notebook, you’ll not only code your own mini-LLM but also develop an intuition for how models like **ChatGPT** are built, trained, and fine-tuned.

### 🌟 Why this repo?

Most resources throw concepts and equations at you. This one keeps it **friendly and engaging**, making sure you understand the *story* before the *details*.

👉 Perfect for students, beginners in AI, or anyone curious about how LLMs like ChatGPT actually work.
